      iOS is Apple's proprietary mobile operating system. Designed originally for the iPhone,
      subsequently also enhanced for use on iPad
      (until the summer of 2019, when a new OS for iPad was presented at the Apple WWDC conference - iPadOS),
      iPod Touch and Apple TV (through September 9, 2015, when tvOS was introduced at Apple's special event).
      Apple does not allow the OS to run on third-party mobile phones. (Known as iPhone OS until June 2010)

The operating system iPhone OS was presented on January 9, 2007 in conjunction with the iPhone 2G smartphone
(the first smartphone from Apple) personally by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo and released in June of the same year.
 Apple did not envision a separate name for the operating system, so the original slogan was: "iPhone runs OS X"

        systems in the 1980s, increased attention was paid to the use of modules
        or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula-2, Ada and ML all
        developed famous modular systems in the 1980s, which were often combined
        to universal software constructions.

        On January 27, 2010, iPad 1 (the first tablet computer from Apple) was presented, for which a special version of iPhone OS 3.2 was created,
         of the features which had a wallpaper on the desktop and a modified Dock.
         iOS 4.0 (a unified version of the iPhone OS, compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) was released at the end of 2010, inheriting most of the innovations,
         introduced in iPhone OS 3.2 (but now on all devices, not just iPad).
